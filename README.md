# spotty
*spotty* is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables
applications to use Spotify's service, without using the official but
closed-source libspotify. Additionally, it will provide extra features
which are not available in the official library.

This is a stripped down and slightly customized version of the plietar's
great plietar/librespot sample executable.
